            <h2>I Like...</h2>
            <h4><span>Projects that focus on good of the society </span>
            Software that creates meaningful impact in people’s lives</h4>
            <p>
                Technology and the world wide web are very powerful, and have the ability to transform our lives.
                We in this industry have the ability make that power accessible to everyone and i am always looking all the ways people are using this to help.
            </p>        

            <h4>
                <span>Open source projects </span> 
                specifically ones that provide competitive alternatives to paid software.
            </h4>
                <p>I am just thrilled that developing excellent software does not mean that it has to come with a price. 
                    I 100% would love to be able to meaningfully contribute to some.</p>

            <h4>
                <span>Equal rights for everyone </span> 
                women, disabled people and, any and all other marginalised people.
            </h4>
                <p>I am well aware of the injustices in society and I aim keep things fair. I want everything I make to be accessible to everyone. 
                    Your constructive criticism and feedback are immensely helpful for me for this reason.</p>

            <h4>
                <span>Sustainability </span> 
                interested in efficient and sustainable use of resources.
            </h4>
            <p>I do not want to waste time, energy or money nor do i want to cause long-term harm to the climate. 
                This is tricky in any industry. So i am always looking out for ways to improve my projects’ sustainability.</p>

            <h4>
                <span>Data and power </span> 
                I am interested to learn how knowledge and information could be used to empower people
            </h4>
            <p>I belive my knowledge in data science can be  used to empower Sri Lankans by making the data they need available and accessible. 
                I am looking forward to using my degree to help my fellow Sri Lankans.</p>
